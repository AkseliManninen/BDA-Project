Notes 10.11.2022

College data
+ Subsetting to make schoolds more similar would be a good idea.
- There might be a lot of other variables affecting than the ones in our dataset (republican etc.) 


Pollution data
+ Relationship is more defined compared to schools and salary
- Asthma migh be already analyzed --> We need to analyze something new


Selecting variables:
- Use common sense first, then projpred R package to select the final
- Check correlation between variables (projpred)
- R package projpred (might not work for hierarchical), used for predictive inference
