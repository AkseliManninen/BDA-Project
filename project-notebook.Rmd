# Project Description

Studying the relationship between income and education has been the focus on many studies, which have 
concluded that there is a strong correlation between higher education and income (Card, 1999). In general, 
individuals with stronger education are more likely to be employed and earn a big salary compared to less 
educated people (Card, 1999). For that reason, education is described as an investment in human capital 
(Wolla & Sullivan, 2017). 

This study examines this phenomenon from the perspective of people that have acquired their education from 
public colleges of the United States. This research is not limited to only considering educational aspects but 
expands it to family backgrounds. As the connection between education and income has been shown in the 
existing literature, this study is more concentrated on the association of the specific features and income.

In this study, a Bayesian approach is taken to observe the bond between the education and family related 
features and earnings. It is in our interest to find out, how accurately the selected features can predict future 
income for the students from public schools. Furthermore, finding the best predictive features amongst the 
vast number of features is pursued. As this study is conducted in a university environment by university 
students, the possible insight would be especially meaningful for the members of the group and peers.
